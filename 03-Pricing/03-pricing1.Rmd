# Pricing for NFP hospitals
Objective is to maximize some function of profits and quantity of care provided, denoted by<br>

$U\left( \pi_{j} = \pi_{i,j} + \pi_{g,j},D_{i,j}, D_{g,j} \right)$<br>

where $\pi_{j}$ denotes total profits for hospital $j$ and $D_{i,j}$ denotes hospital demand from insurer $i$. We assume that $p_{j}$ is exogenous and determined by a public payer, so the hospital need only set its price for private insurance customers, $p_{i}$.

---
# Solution for NFP hospital
The hospital chooses $p_{i}$ such that<br>

$\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}} = U_{1} \pi_{1}^{i} + U_{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}D_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}=0$,<br>

where $U_{1}$ denotes the derivative of $U(\cdot)$ with respect to its first argument and similarly for $U_{2}$.<br>

--

In general, we can't solve this directly without knowing the hospital's utility function.

# Example

Consider the firm's demand curve, $d=16-q$, and cost curve, $c(q)=5+q^{2}$. Where will the firm produce and at what price? What is the firm's markup over marginal cost?

--
The profit function is, $\pi = (16-q)q - 5 - q^{2}$. Differentiating with respect to quantity yields $-q + 16 - q - 2q= 16-4q=0$, or $q=4$. At this quantity, the price is $p=12$, which is a markup of 4 over the marginal cost (or 50% markup).

---
# In-class problem (unilateral pricing)

Consider the firm's demand curve, $d=40-2q$, and cost curve, $c(q)=5q+\frac{1}{2}q^{2}$. 

1. What is the firm's profit maximizing choice of quantity and price? 
2. What is the markup over marginal cost?

# Two-price Market

# Relationship between prices
In health care, providers usually face two prices:

1. A price fixed by Medicare and Medicaid, $p_{m}$.
2. A price that is negotiated with insurers, $p_{n}$.

How does $p_{m}$ affect $p_{n}$?<br>

# Two price market and NFP
Although we don't know the general solution for the private price, we can find how it varies with the public price...<br>

--

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{j}} = - \frac{U_{11}\pi_{1}^{i}\pi_{1}^{j} + \frac{\mathrm{d}D_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}U_{12}\pi_{1}^{j}}{\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}U}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}^{2}}}$$

# In-class problem (two-price market)
Consider the firm's demand curve in the private insurance market, $d=16-q$, and costs, $c(q)=5+q^{2}$. Assume that there exists a public insurer that pays a fixed price of $\bar{p}=10$.<br>

1. How many private patients will the provider serve? 
2. How many public patients? 
3. What if $\bar{p}$ drops to <span>&#36;</span>9.

# Cost-shifting
- Relationship between public and private price is important
- Speaks to anticipated effects of a change in Medicaid or Medicare rates
- Do hospitals "make up" the difference?<br>

--

The idea that hospitals will increase private prices following a decrease in the public price is called <b>cost shifting</b>. 

---
# Cost-shifting
But how could it happen?<br>

--

Assumes that hospitals could have increased private prices earlier but chose not too. This is technically possible if, for example:
- Hospital has very low margins (maybe negative with a lower public price)
- Insurer wants to prop up the hospital for competitive reasons
- Hospital has diminishing returns to profits<br>

--

but economists usually see this as a smaller effect than most policy makers.
