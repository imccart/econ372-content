# History of hospitals

- Before 1900: Just don't go to the hospital! (at least in the U.S.)
  - mainly charity care
  - hospitals were a learning experience for physicians

- Early 1900s: big safety and technological improvements

- Mid 1900s: huge growth, especially in wealthy and urban areas
  - Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 (Social Security Act)

---
# Now
As we know, we now spend &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; on health care in the U.S., and a big part of that is very high health care prices (and a big part of that is hospital prices)


---
# Ownership types

1. Private not-for-profit: About 60%

2. For-profit: About 20%

3. State and local gov't: About 20%

# Non-profit hospitals
What does it mean to be a not-for-profit hospital?&lt;br&gt;

--

From an economics perspective:
- Hospital assumed to maximize some objective function, `\(u(q,z)\)`, subject to a production constraint

- `\(q\)` denotes quantity of care and `\(z\)` denotes quality of care

- Production is constrained by the break-even condition

---
# Non-profit hospitals
What does it mean to be a not-for-profit hospital?&lt;br&gt;

--

From a practical perspective:
- Profits must be re-invested into the hospital

- Must show "community benefit" (no consensus definition...includes uncompensated care, services to Medicaid, and certain specialized services that are generally unprofitable)

- No taxes! and tax-free bonds

---
# Non-profit hospitals and tax benefits
- &lt;span&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/span&gt;24.6 billion in tax exemptions in 2011

- &lt;span&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/span&gt;62.4 billion in "community benefits"&lt;br&gt;

- [Washington Post Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/value-of-tax-breaks-for-nonprofit-hospitals-doubled-in-a-decade/2015/06/17/4162c640-1450-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html?utm_term=.4f877a72a09f)&lt;br&gt;

--

What do you think? Are these community benefits measured appropriately?


---
# What is a non-profit hospital?
The real question is...what is the hospital's objective function?

- For-profit in disguise
- Output maximizers
- Tax-benefit maximizers
- Social welfare maximizers&lt;br&gt;

--

Most empirical evidence doesn't find much of a difference between FP and NFP hospitals, except FPs have higher prices. Why is that?


---
# For-profit hospitals
These are easier to study theoretically...just a standard profit maximizing firm.

- `\(\pi=P(q)q - C(q),\)` where `\(q\)` denotes quantity of care

- Firm has some market power and so faces a downward sloping demand curve

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
# Pricing for NFP hospitals
Objective is to maximize some function of profits and quantity of care provided, denoted by&lt;br&gt;

`\(U\left( \pi_{j} = \pi_{i,j} + \pi_{g,j},D_{i,j}, D_{g,j} \right)\)`&lt;br&gt;

where `\(\pi_{j}\)` denotes total profits for hospital `\(j\)` and `\(D_{i,j}\)` denotes hospital demand from insurer `\(i\)`. We assume that `\(p_{j}\)` is exogenous and determined by a public payer, so the hospital need only set its price for private insurance customers, `\(p_{i}\)`.

---
# Solution for NFP hospital
The hospital chooses `\(p_{i}\)` such that&lt;br&gt;

`\(\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}} = U_{1} \pi_{1}^{i} + U_{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}D_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}=0\)`,&lt;br&gt;

where `\(U_{1}\)` denotes the derivative of `\(U(\cdot)\)` with respect to its first argument and similarly for `\(U_{2}\)`.&lt;br&gt;

--

In general, we can't solve this directly without knowing the hospital's utility function.

# Assuming pure profit maximization

# Example

Consider the firm's demand curve, `\(d=16-q\)`, and cost curve, `\(c(q)=5+q^{2}\)`. Where will the firm produce and at what price? What is the firm's markup over marginal cost?

--
The profit function is, `\(\pi = (16-q)q - 5 - q^{2}\)`. Differentiating with respect to quantity yields `\(-q + 16 - q - 2q= 16-4q=0\)`, or `\(q=4\)`. At this quantity, the price is `\(p=12\)`, which is a markup of 4 over the marginal cost (or 50% markup).

---
# In-class problem (unilateral pricing)

Consider the firm's demand curve, `\(d=40-2q\)`, and cost curve, `\(c(q)=5q+\frac{1}{2}q^{2}\)`. 

1. What is the firm's profit maximizing choice of quantity and price? 
2. What is the markup over marginal cost?

# Two-price Market

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
# Relationship between prices
In health care, providers usually face two prices:

1. A price fixed by Medicare and Medicaid, `\(p_{m}\)`.
2. A price that is negotiated with insurers, `\(p_{n}\)`.

How does `\(p_{m}\)` affect `\(p_{n}\)`?&lt;br&gt;

---
# Two price market and NFP
Although we don't know the general solution for the private price, we can find how it varies with the public price...&lt;br&gt;

--

`$$\frac{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{j}} = - \frac{U_{11}\pi_{1}^{i}\pi_{1}^{j} + \frac{\mathrm{d}D_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}U_{12}\pi_{1}^{j}}{\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}U}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}^{2}}}$$`

---
# Two price market and FP
.pull-left[
- Sell to "private" market as long as marginal revenue exceeds the public price
- Switch to "public'" market otherwise, and sell to the point where price equals marginal cost

# In-class problem (two-price market)
Consider the firm's demand curve in the private insurance market, `\(d=16-q\)`, and costs, `\(c(q)=5+q^{2}\)`. Assume that there exists a public insurer that pays a fixed price of `\(\bar{p}=10\)`.&lt;br&gt;

1. How many private patients will the provider serve? 
2. How many public patients? 
3. What if `\(\bar{p}\)` drops to &lt;span&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/span&gt;9.

---
# Cost-shifting
- Relationship between public and private price is important
- Speaks to anticipated effects of a change in Medicaid or Medicare rates
- Do hospitals "make up" the difference?&lt;br&gt;

--

The idea that hospitals will increase private prices following a decrease in the public price is called &lt;b&gt;cost shifting&lt;/b&gt;. 

---
# Cost-shifting
But how could it happen?&lt;br&gt;

--

Assumes that hospitals could have increased private prices earlier but chose not too. This is technically possible if, for example:
- Hospital has very low margins (maybe negative with a lower public price)
- Insurer wants to prop up the hospital for competitive reasons
- Hospital has diminishing returns to profits&lt;br&gt;

--

but economists usually see this as a smaller effect than most policy makers.

# What is a hospital price?

In practice, it's a negotiation with insurers
- Hospitals can't set price on their own
- Negotiation with insurers
- Bargaining problem where insurer and hospital split some total amount
- Agent/entity with higher bargaining position will get larger share

- [Medicaid payments](https://www.kff.org/report-section/understanding-medicaid-hospital-payments-and-the-impact-of-recent-policy-changes-issue-brief/)
- Private insurance negotiations (including Medicare Advantage)
- But what about the price to patients?

# Hospital prices in real life
We'll get into the real data in a bit, but for now...a few facts:

1. Hospital services are expensive

2. Prices vary dramatically across different areas

3. Lack of competition is a major reason for high prices

---
# Nash Bargaining problem
We model this bargaining problem as a "Nash bargaining" problem.
- Two people are faced with a negotiation
- If they agree, each gets payoffs `\(u_{1}\)` `\(u_{2}\)`, respectively
- If they disagree, each gets some other payoff, `\(t_{1}\)` and `\(t_{2}\)`, with `\(u_{1} &gt; t_{1}\)` and `\(u_{2} &gt; t_{2}\)` 
- Nash showed that the solution is `\(\max (u_{1}- t_{1})(u_{2} - t_{2})\)`

---
# Understanding the outside option
Key part of understanding effect on price is to understand the "outside option". What does this mean?&lt;br&gt;

--

Outside option in this case is the profit to the hospital or insurer if a negotiation "breaks down". What is the outside option to an insurer if they are in a monopoly hospital market?


---
# In-class problem (Nash bargaining)
Assume that two agents are negotiating over how best to divide their quantity of good x, which is normalized to 1. If the players reach an agreement, player 1 receives utility `\(u_{1} = x\)`, and player 2 receives utility `\(u_{2} = (1-x)\)`. If the players do not reach an agreement, player 1 receives a payoff of `\(t1 = 0\)`, and
player 2 receives payoff `\(t_{2} = a &gt; 0\)`.&lt;br&gt;

1. Find the Nash bargaining solution to this game.
2. Explain how this solution varies with `\(a\)`.

---
# Central Empirical Issues
At least 2 related issues in studying hospital competitiveness:
1. How do we measure "competitiveness"?
2. What is the effect of competition?

---
# Measuring competitiveness
- Common measure is Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), `\(\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}^{2}\)`.
  - 2,500 is considered **highly concentrated**
  - 1,800 is considered **unconcentrated**
- "Willingness to pay" is more recent measure (theoretically supported)
- Both require a measure of the geographic market

---
# Defining the market
Lots of subjectivity...
- Radius around a hospital?
- Concentric circles to define "catchment" areas?
- Patient/physician referrals?
- At what product-level do hospitals compete?

---
# Trends in competitiveness
Almost any way you define it, hospital markets are more and more concentrated (less competitive) in recent decades.
- 1990: 65% of MSAs highlgy concentrated, 23% unconcentrated
- 2006: 77% highly concentrated, 11% unconcentrated

# Hospital concentration over time
- More data and [interactive report](https://healthcostinstitute.org/hcci-originals/healthy-marketplace-index/hmi) from the Health Care Cost Institute.
- [Presentation](https://nihcm.org/publications/hospital-consolidation-trends-impacts-outlook) from the National Institute for Health Care Management

---
# Why?
Historical perception of hospital competition as "wasteful" and assumption that more capacity means more (unnecessary) care:
- Limit public spending by limiting competition
- Prevalence of certificate of need (CON) laws

---
# Effects of reduced competition
1. Higher prices
2. Lower quality, [2020 NEJM Paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1901383)
3. Maybe lower costs (but not passed on to lower prices)&lt;br&gt;

# Different merger types
Essentially two types of mergers:

1. "Within-market"
2. "Out-of-market"

--

Why do you think these matter?


---
# Within-market mergers

- Most well-understood merger type
- Established tools for examination in anti-trust
- Defining the market is still a contentious issue

---
count: false

# Within-market mergers

- Listed previously (Emory-DeKalb, etc.)
- **Big** price effects
  - 20 to 40% in many studies
  - Up to 60% in some studies
  - Bigger increases the closer are the hospitals
  - Price increases spillover to other hospitals too
- Account for about 50% of all mergers since 2000


---
# Out-of-market mergers

- Less understood
- No formal structure for analyzing in court
- These types of mergers are essentially permitted without risk of DOJ/FTC challenge

---
count: false

# Out-of-market mergers

- Involve larger systems spanning different isolated markets
  - Advocate-Aurora: 27 hospital system in IL and WI
  - Baptist Memorial-Mississippi Baptist: 22 hospitals in TN, AR, and MS
  - UPMC-Pinnacle: 24 hospital system recently added 8 in central PA
  - Catholic Health Initiatives-Dignity Health: 142 hospitals in 21 states
  - HCA: 177 hospitals in 21 states
  - RCCH HealthCare Partners: 89 hospitals in 30 states, focusing on non-urban areas
- About 35% of all mergers are out-of-market but in same state, 15% out-of-state
- Smaller but meaningful price increases, 5 to 10%

---
# How do they increase prices?

- Already discussed within-market mergers, outside options, and bargaining power
- What about out-of-market mergers?

---
count: false

# How do they increase prices?

Two ways this can happen theoretically:

1. Common customers (hospital markets are local, but insurance markets are more broad)
2. Multi-market contact (particularly relevant for understanding out-of-state mergers)

---
# 1. Common customers

---
# 2. Multimarket contact

# Where do we go frome here?

1. Adopt sensible policies
2. Antitrust enforcement
