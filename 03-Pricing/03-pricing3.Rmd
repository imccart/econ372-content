# Central Empirical Issues
At least 2 related issues in studying hospital competitiveness:
1. How do we measure "competitiveness"?
2. What is the effect of competition?

---
# Measuring competitiveness
- Common measure is Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), $\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}^{2}$.
  - 2,500 is considered **highly concentrated**
  - 1,800 is considered **unconcentrated**
- "Willingness to pay" is more recent measure (theoretically supported)
- Both require a measure of the geographic market

---
# Defining the market
Lots of subjectivity...
- Radius around a hospital?
- Concentric circles to define "catchment" areas?
- Patient/physician referrals?
- At what product-level do hospitals compete?

---
# Trends in competitiveness
Almost any way you define it, hospital markets are more and more concentrated (less competitive) in recent decades.
- 1990: 65% of MSAs highlgy concentrated, 23% unconcentrated
- 2006: 77% highly concentrated, 11% unconcentrated

# Hospital concentration over time
- More data and [interactive report](https://healthcostinstitute.org/hcci-originals/healthy-marketplace-index/hmi) from the Health Care Cost Institute.
- [Presentation](https://nihcm.org/publications/hospital-consolidation-trends-impacts-outlook) from the National Institute for Health Care Management

---
# Why?
Historical perception of hospital competition as "wasteful" and assumption that more capacity means more (unnecessary) care:
- Limit public spending by limiting competition
- Prevalence of certificate of need (CON) laws

---
# Effects of reduced competition
1. Higher prices
2. Lower quality, [2020 NEJM Paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1901383)
3. Maybe lower costs (but not passed on to lower prices)<br>

Effects for both "in-market" and "out-of-market" mergers

# Modeling competition and prices

Health care providers compete on both quality and price (possibly other dimensions such as access or wait times). This complicates our theoretical analysis of competition.


---
# Competition with fixed prices

- Demand: $q_{j}=s_{j}(z_{j}) \times D(\bar{p})$
- Costs: $c_{j}=c(q_{j},z_{j}) + F$
- Profits: $\pi_{j} = \bar{p}q_{j} - c_{j}$


Hospitals choose quality such that:

$$\frac{d \pi_{j}}{d z_{j}} = \left(\bar{p} - \frac{d c_{j}}{d q_{j}} \right)\left(\frac{d s_{j}}{d z_{j}}D + s_{j}\frac{d D}{d z_{j}} \right) - \frac{d c_{j}}{d z_{j}}=0$$


---
# Competition with fixed prices

- Increase in competition will tend to increase quality
- Negative welfare effects if $\frac{d D}{d z_{j}}$ is sufficiently small and fixed costs are large

---
# Competition with market prices

Profit given by $\pi = q(p,z) \times (p-c-d\times z) - F,$ which yields
$$\begin{align*}
p &= \frac{\epsilon_{p}}{\epsilon_{p}-1} (c+dz) \\
z &= \frac{\epsilon_{z}}{\epsilon_{z}+1} \frac{p-c}{d}
\end{align*}$$


---
# Competition with market prices

Rewrite in terms of elasticities:
$$\begin{align*}
\epsilon_{p} &= \frac{p}{p-c-dz} \\
\epsilon_{z} &= \frac{dz}{p - c - dz}
\end{align*}$$

Taking the ratio and solving for $z$ yields, $$z = \frac{p}{d}\times \frac{\epsilon_{z}}{\epsilon_{p}},$$    

---
# Competition with market prices

Dorfman-Steiner condition:

- Quality increases if the quality elasticity increases or if price increases
- Quality increases if the price elasticity decreases or the marginal cost of quality decreases
- **Prediction for competition:** If competition has a large effect in terms of price elasticity (i.e., consumers are heavily responsive to the price effects from increased competition), then quality may decrease. If instead competition has a large effect in terms of quality elasticity (i.e., consumers are more responsive to quality changes), then quality will increase.
