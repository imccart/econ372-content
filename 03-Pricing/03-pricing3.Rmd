# Central Empirical Issues
At least 2 related issues in studying hospital competitiveness:
1. How do we measure "competitiveness"?
2. What is the effect of competition?

---
# Measuring competitiveness
- Common measure is Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), $\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}^{2}$.
  - 2,500 is considered **highly concentrated**
  - 1,800 is considered **unconcentrated**
- "Willingness to pay" is more recent measure (theoretically supported)
- Both require a measure of the geographic market

---
# Defining the market
Lots of subjectivity...
- Radius around a hospital?
- Concentric circles to define "catchment" areas?
- Patient/physician referrals?
- At what product-level do hospitals compete?

---
# Trends in competitiveness
Almost any way you define it, hospital markets are more and more concentrated (less competitive) in recent decades.
- 1990: 65% of MSAs highlgy concentrated, 23% unconcentrated
- 2006: 77% highly concentrated, 11% unconcentrated

# Hospital concentration over time
- More data and [interactive report](https://healthcostinstitute.org/hcci-originals/healthy-marketplace-index/hmi) from the Health Care Cost Institute.
- [Presentation](https://nihcm.org/publications/hospital-consolidation-trends-impacts-outlook) from the National Institute for Health Care Management

---
# Why?
Historical perception of hospital competition as "wasteful" and assumption that more capacity means more (unnecessary) care:
- Limit public spending by limiting competition
- Prevalence of certificate of need (CON) laws

---
# Effects of reduced competition
1. Higher prices
2. Lower quality, [2020 NEJM Paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1901383)
3. Maybe lower costs (but not passed on to lower prices)<br>
