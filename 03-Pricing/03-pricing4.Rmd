# Different merger types
Essentially two types of mergers:

1. "Within-market"
2. "Out-of-market"

--

Why do you think these matter?


---
# Within-market mergers

- Most well-understood merger type
- Established tools for examination in anti-trust
- Defining the market is still a contentious issue

---
# Within-market mergers

- Listed previously (Emory-DeKalb, etc.)
- **Big** price effects
  - 20 to 40% in many studies
  - Up to 60% in some studies
  - Bigger increases the closer are the hospitals
  - Price increases spillover to other hospitals too
- Account for about 50% of all mergers since 2000


---
# Out-of-market mergers

- Less understood
- No formal structure for analyzing in court
- These types of mergers are essentially permitted without risk of DOJ/FTC challenge

---
# Out-of-market mergers

- Involve larger systems spanning different isolated markets
  - Advocate-Aurora: 27 hospital system in IL and WI
  - Baptist Memorial-Mississippi Baptist: 22 hospitals in TN, AR, and MS
  - UPMC-Pinnacle: 24 hospital system recently added 8 in central PA
  - Catholic Health Initiatives-Dignity Health: 142 hospitals in 21 states
  - HCA: 177 hospitals in 21 states
  - RCCH HealthCare Partners: 89 hospitals in 30 states, focusing on non-urban areas
- About 35% of all mergers are out-of-market but in same state, 15% out-of-state
- Smaller but meaningful price increases, 5 to 10%

---
# How do they increase prices?

- Already discussed within-market mergers, outside options, and bargaining power
- What about out-of-market mergers?

---
# How do they increase prices?

Two ways this can happen theoretically:

1. Common customers (hospital markets are local, but insurance markets are more broad)
2. Multi-market contact (particularly relevant for understanding out-of-state mergers)

# Where do we go frome here?

1. Adopt sensible policies
2. Antitrust enforcement
