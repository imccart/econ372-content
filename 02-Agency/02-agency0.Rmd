# What is physician agency

The idea of physician agency is simple - physicians know more than patients, and so some amount of care is malleable.

# Variation in care

Such variation in care is a clear reflection of just how malleable health care is. Some areas have substantially more care than others which is not explained by health or patient preferences.

Why does this variation matter? It suggests that there's an opportunity to reduce care without hurting patients.

# Wasteful?
- Estimates are that more than 30% of health care expenditures are "wasteful": [(The Atlantic, 2013)](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/youre-getting-too-much-healthcare/281896/)

- Some clear areas of waste:
  - Payment differentials by location of treatment (policy quirks)
  - Better imaging with little benefit
  - Proton treatment (for some conditions)
  - Heart stents (for some patients)
  - Arthroscopic knee surgery<br>

Many estimates of "waste" are after-the-fact. It's actually very hard to identify waste before-hand. [Report on End-of-life Spending](http://news.mit.edu/2018/value-late-life-health-care-spending-medicare-0628)
