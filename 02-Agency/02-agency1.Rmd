# Definition

Physicians are better informed about treatment decisions than patients, and so there exists some <b>agency</b> relationship between the two. For many conditions, patients can't treat themselves even if they wanted to.

---
# Setup
- Denote quantity of physician services by $x$

- Denote benefit of services to patient by $B(x)$

- Patients pay (and physicians receive) a price of $p$ for each unit of service $x$

- Physicians incur cost $c$ for each unit of care

- Net benefit to patients is $NB(x)=B(x)-px$

- Physicians must choose quantity of care at least better than the patient's outside option, $NB(x)= B(x)-px \geq NB^{0}$.


---
# Solving the model
With this framework, how much care will be provided? (i.e., what is the optimal value of $x$) <br>

--

Solve the model in two steps:<br>

1. Physician will provide minimum surplus to keep the patient, $NB(x) = B(x)-px = NB^{0}$

2. Substitute into physician profit function, $\pi=(p-c)x = B(x)-NB^{0} - cx$, and solve for $x$<br>

---
# Solving the model

This two step approach applies when prices and quantity of care are variable. If the physician cannot set price, then we just work off of the constraint, $B(x)-\bar{p}x=NB^{0}$. 


--

Why? This is a corner solution...can't just take a derivative.


---
# In-class Problem: Physician agency
Denote the quantity of care consumed by $x$, and denote by $B(x)$ the function that determines the benefit of care to the patient. Assume that the patient must pay the full price of care, $px$, so that their net benefit is $NB=B(x)−px$. Further assume that the physician can choose both $x$ and $p$.  

1. Find the patient’s optimal $x$.
2. Draw the marginal benefit function on a graph and note the price and patient's optimal quantity. Assume that $B'(x)>0$ and $B''(x)<0$ (i.e., the marginal benefit function is positive and downward sloping).
3. Find the physician's optimal $x$ assuming $NB^{0}=0$. 
4. Add the physician's optimal $x$ to your graph and interpret the difference.

# Example
Assume $B(x)=8x^{1/2}$, $NB^{0}=2$, and $c=1$:<br>

1. Find the physician's optimal level of $x$ and $p$.
2. Find the patient's optimal level of $x$.
3. Draw this graphically.

---
# Answer
First let's re-write the constraint such that $px = 8x^{1/2}$ and $\pi = 8x^{1/2} - 2 - x$. The first order condition for $x$ is then $4x^{-1/2} -1 =0$, which is satisfied at $x^{*}=16$. Substituting this into the constraint, $8x^{1/2} - px=2$ yields $p=\frac{15}{8}$. 


But if they could choose on their own, the patient would prefer to maximize their net benefit. This would occur at $4x^{-1/2}=p$, which yields $x=(32/15)^{2} \approx 4.5$ at $p=15/8$.
